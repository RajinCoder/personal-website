          Hey, My name is Peter Moise, I'm a second year studying computer
          science at Northeastern University. Originally from Central Florida, I
          come from a big Carribbean family with a love for sports. As a result
          I've always followed sportsâ€”I've been playing soccer for over 7 years
          and I'm also a huge fan of basketball. Other than that, you'll find me
          gaming, cooking up in the kitchen, or watching a good movie.
          <br />
          <br />
          My interest in tech started in middle school after I got a game for my
          birthday and became interested in how it was made; This led me down a
          youtube rabbit hole and eventually led to my love for programming.
          Right now, I'm really into mobile development and tinkering with APIs.
          I'm on the lookout for Co-Ops from Summer through Fall 2024. Connect
          with me if you have any questions, opportunities, or just want to
          talk.
        </p>
